Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Ive built the core of my project. A python game where the person has to crack a randomly generated 4-3digit code. I put in like a hint system, logging and a replay option.
#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I havent figured out how to make the game easier. Ive watched some videos on games similar to mines but Im still tryna figure it out. I still need to finalize an example output file and zip everythign together
#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I was kinda confused on file logging and string formatting. But I was able to look into stuff like that. I just need to figure out how i could make the game easier
